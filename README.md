# nodejs-express-tutorial
A quick tutorial on using Express.js

# Install
Simply run `npm install` once you've cloned the repo

# Run an example
There are a bit of examples. Feel free to look over each index#.js file and review the differences on how each works.

For example, you can see the `port` is 8080.  So if we run `npm run test1` and then open a broser on our machine and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (where 8080 is the port we assigned) we can see the example it brings up.

# Additional Info
You can review the `package.json` file to view additional test scripts to run.
